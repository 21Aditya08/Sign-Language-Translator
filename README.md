# Sign-Language-Translator
Using TensorFlow to translate Sign Language in real-time. **_Final Release_**

My project on Computer Science as well as The <a href="https://tensorflow.devpost.com/">âš¡#PoweredByTF 2.0 Challenge!</a> has been about developing a Sign Language Translator. The objectives to improve the communication of users with their machines and with each other. More concretely, this program allows one to perform multiple word signs with a single gesture or even to click a button and copy the translated result. Users can also video call one another and speak in gestures which are converted into Computer Speech.
